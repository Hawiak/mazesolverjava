# mazesolverjava

Maze sovler project for a school assignment
I need to implement a strategy design and I was inspired by https://github.com/mikepound/mazesolving and his video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rop0W4QDOUI
However, Python doesnt require you to properly inplement strategy patterns as it has a different structure so I gave Java a shot.
